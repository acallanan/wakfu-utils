This folder is for stuff not from Ankama's official item data that we find useful.

It's intended to be easy to contribute to, and if you are unfamliar with Github,
reach out in discord and I'll be happy to help include community sourced data here.


the item *id* belongs on a single line for each of the below.
If you don't know the item id, getting me a combination of name, locale the name is in, and rarity is sufficient.

- craftable.txt: if the item is craftable (including upgrades from drops) the item id belongs here
- droppable.txt: if the item is a drop (Regardless of source) it belongs here
- riftable: if it can drop in a rift, it belongs here (as well)
- dungeon: if it drops in a dungeon, it goes here

(and so on)


Note: Blueprints are in the item data already, no need to track those down.

If you want another category, ask


This data will be compiled into both json and sqlite dbs regularly for release.
